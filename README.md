ðŸ§  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on MNIST
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Keras to generate handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Features:
Data normalization and preprocessing

Custom Generator and Discriminator model architectures

Adversarial training loop with loss functions and optimizers

Real-time image generation and visualization

Progressive improvement in output quality across training epochs

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Train a GAN to learn the distribution of MNIST digits and generate new, realistic handwritten digit images from random noise.
